FactoryBase provides a way to dynamically create entities based on
information provided by the defaultDictionary instance method.

Subclasses must have their names prefixed with the entity name (eg, UserFactory
for a User entity). FactoryBase dynamically discovers the entity name based
on its class name.

FactoryBase allows for overriding the existing default dictionary by passing
a custom dictionary to the createWithDictionary or buildWithDictionary methods

Custom dictionaries and the defaultDictionary are merged, removing the need to
pass in all keys along with custom overrides

This class expects a class called DataSupport to be defined with a class method
named mainManagedObjectContext that returns an NSManagedObjectContext
